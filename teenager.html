            THE TEENAGER SEEMS SHY AND UNCOMFORTABLE </br>
            YOU WONDER WHAT HE IS LISTENING TO</br>
            THE LADIES TALK TO HIM, POOR TEENAGER</br>
            TTHEY ASK HIM WHAT HE WANTS TO BE WHEN HE GROWS UP </br>
            HE WANTS TO BE A SINGER- HE IS SURE  </br>
            THE LADIES DON’T GET IT  </br>
            YOU ALSO DON’T GET WHY YOU WERE NEVER SO SURE ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP </br>
            THE BOY PUTS HIS HEADPHONES BACK ON, AND YOU THINK YOU CAN HEAR K-POP MUSIC PLAYING </br>
            WHERE IS THE HAIRDRESSER ANYWAY? </br>
